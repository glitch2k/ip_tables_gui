***** IP TABLES *****

GOAL:
    - an application to manage ip tables rules via a web interface

MANUAL PROCESS:
    - The user will have to know the following before hand:
        - What is the system
            - a host
            - a device
                - a router
                - a firewall
        
        - What actions to perform on the packet
            - Filtering/Blocking
            - Translation
                - SNAT
                - DNAT
                - Masquerading
                - Port forwarding
                - Modifying the packet header (mangle)
            - Logging

        - Where in the packet procss do you want the action to take
        place
            - Before "mine or yours" decision
            - Before routing/forwarding decision
            - Before packet is sent to the process
            - After the process responces
            - After routing/forwarding decision 
            - Before packet is sent out the interface

        - How to match the packet

        - What IPTable specific action must be done

    - Packet traffic scenario for manual process
        - Host
            - Host -> filter -> ...
                - host -> filter -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                - host -> filter -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                - host -> filter -> Before packet is sent to the process
                - host -> filter -> After the process responces
                - host -> filter -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                - host -> filter -> Before packet is sent out the interface

            - Host -> Translation -> ...
                - SNAT
                    - host -> SNAT -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                    - host -> SNAT -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                    - host -> SNAT -> Before packet is sent to the process
                    - host -> SNAT -> After the process responces
                    - host -> SNAT -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                    - host -> SNAT -> Before packet is sent out the interface
                - DNAT
                    - host -> DNAT -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                    - host -> DNAT -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                    - host -> DNAT -> Before packet is sent to the process
                    - host -> DNAT -> After the process responces
                    - host -> DNAT -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                    - host -> DNAT -> Before packet is sent out the interface
                - Masquerading
                    - host -> Masquerading -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                    - host -> Masquerading -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                    - host -> Masquerading -> Before packet is sent to the process
                    - host -> Masquerading -> After the process responces
                    - host -> Masquerading -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                    - host -> Masquerading -> Before packet is sent out the interface
                - Port forwarding
                    - host -> Port forwarding -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                    - host -> Port forwarding -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                    - host -> Port forwarding -> Before packet is sent to the process
                    - host -> Port forwarding -> After the process responces
                    - host -> Port forwarding -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                    - host -> Port forwarding -> Before packet is sent out the interface
                - Modifying the packet header (mangle)
                    - host -> Modifying the packet header (mangle) -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                    - host -> Modifying the packet header (mangle) -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                    - host -> Modifying the packet header (mangle) -> Before packet is sent to the process
                    - host -> Modifying the packet header (mangle) -> After the process responces
                    - host -> Modifying the packet header (mangle) -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                    - host -> Modifying the packet header (mangle) -> Before packet is sent out the interface

            - Host -> Logging -> ...
                - host -> Logging -> Before "mine or yours" decision
                - host -> Logging -> Before routing/forwarding decision
                - host -> Logging -> Before packet is sent to the process
                - host -> Logging -> After the process responces
                - host -> Logging -> After routing/forwarding decision 
                - host -> Logging -> Before packet is sent out the interface

TESTING
    - Where will packets travel? (solution must be able to be reached
    by web server hosted locally)
        - Docker Desktop / Portainer

    - What kind of packets will I send?
        - JPerf (GUI for iperf3)

    - What behavior am I testing?
        - ubuntu container
    
    - What happened to the packet? (must be able to be monitored 
    remotely)
        - Wireshark 
    - Did the system behave correctly?
