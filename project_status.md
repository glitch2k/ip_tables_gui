    4. [x] Flush tables  
    5. [x] Restore config  
    6. [x] Verify restored rules  
    7. [x] Delete test rule  
  - [x] Confirmed all operations pass end-to-end.  
  ✅ **Status:** Completed and validated.

- [x] Configuration save/restore  
- [x] Automated functional testing  
- [x] Live code synchronization via Docker volumes  

🔹 **Outcome:** Local firewall management backend is complete, stable, and production-ready for expansion.

---

## **Phase 3 – SSH Agentless Connectivity**

### 🎯 Goal  
Enable secure, key-based, agentless SSH communication between the backend controller and multiple managed systems (firewall, client, and server containers).  
Provide the ability to execute commands, transfer files, maintain sessions, and discover reachable hosts — all without local agents.

---

### **Milestone 1 – Establish SSH Connectivity**
- [x] Step 1 – Generate SSH key pair and configure authorized_keys on firewall  
- [x] Step 2 – Verify key-based SSH login from host to firewall  
- [x] Step 3 – Implement `test_ssh_connection.py` for backend connectivity verification  
- [x] Step 4 – Validate connectivity logs and permissions fixes  

---

### **Milestone 2 – Remote Command Execution Framework**
- [x] Step 1 – Create `remote_command_executor.py` to execute shell commands remotely  
- [x] Step 2 – Add structured JSON logging for command execution results  
- [x] Step 3 – Add command validation / whitelist safety controls  
- [x] Step 4 – Confirm verified command output from firewall container  

**Outcome:**  
Backend can securely execute validated iptables or diagnostic commands on any SSH-reachable host and record structured results.

---

### **Milestone 3 – Multi-Host SSH Operations**
- [x] Step 1 – Implement `multi_host_executor.py` for parallel SSH execution across multiple containers  
- [x] Step 2 – Develop persistent `SSHSessionManager` for reusable connections  
- [x] Step 3 – Enhance resilience with automatic retries + connection health metrics  
- [x] Step 4 – Add `ssh_file_transfer.py` for SFTP upload / download of configs and logs  
- [x] Step 5 – Add `host_discovery.py` for network reachability + SSH discovery  

**Outcome:**  
Backend now functions as an **agentless controller**, capable of managing multiple SSH hosts concurrently, transferring files, maintaining session pools, and discovering reachable nodes in the network.

---

### ✅ **Phase 3 Summary**
- Fully operational SSH-based backend controller  
- Persistent and resilient SSH session management  
- Secure file transfer via shared sessions  
- Multi-host parallel execution and discovery
