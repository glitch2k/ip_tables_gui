  ✅ **Status:** Completed.

---

- [x] **Milestone 5: Automated Test Harness**

    3. [x] Save config  
    4. [x] Flush tables  
    5. [x] Restore config  
    6. [x] Verify restored rules  
    7. [x] Delete test rule  
  - [x] Confirmed all operations pass end-to-end.  
  ✅ **Status:** Completed and validated.

---

### 🧠 **Phase 2 Summary**
✅ Backend engine now supports:
- [x] Rule listing, adding, and deletion  
- [x] Configuration save/restore  
- [x] Automated functional testing  
- [x] Live code synchronization via Docker volumes  

🔹 **Outcome:** Local firewall management backend is complete, stable, and production-ready for expansion.

## 🌐 **Phase 3 – Remote Connectivity Layer**

### 🎯 **Goal**
Extend the backend to manage **remote firewalls** using a **RESTful API agent architecture** (with optional SSH fallback).

### 🧩 **Milestones**

- [x] **Milestone 1: Remote Controller Setup** *(In Progress)*  
  - [x] Create `app/core/remote_controller.py`.  
  - [ ] Install and configure Flask/FastAPI-based agent template.  
  - [ ] Implement secure communication with authentication (JWT/API key).  
  - [ ] Test connection validation and health endpoint (`/api/status`).  
  🟡 **Status:** In Progress.

---

- [ ] **Milestone 2: Remote Command Execution**
