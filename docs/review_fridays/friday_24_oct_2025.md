# 🗓️ Documentation Day – October 24, 2025  
_Project: iptables GUI Configuration System_

---

## 📘 1. What We Accomplished This Week

**Phase 4 – Remote Configuration Management over SSH**
- ✅ Completed **Milestone 1 (Remote Ruleset Push)**:
  - Built modules:
    - `iptables_push.py` → Upload iptables rules via SSH SFTP
    - `iptables_validate.py` → Syntax check using `iptables-restore --test`
    - `iptables_apply.py` → Apply validated rules with `iptables-restore < file`
    - `iptables_logger.py` → Log every operation to the Knowledge Base (`logs/kb/iptables_kb.jsonl`)
  - Created `test_phase4_integration.py` to verify end-to-end flow (push → validate → apply → log)
  - All components tested successfully inside Docker environment

**Phase 5 – API Layer and GUI Integration**
- ✅ Started **Milestone 1 (Flask API Layer)**:
  - Built `app/api/app.py` exposing `/api/push`, `/api/validate`, `/api/apply`, and `/api/logs`
  - Verified API routes using `curl`
  - Confirmed JSON responses and KB logging through API calls

## ⚠️ 2. Problems Encountered

| # | Problem Description | Recommended Solution | Likely Cause | Related Tech/Protocol | PMS Location |
|---|---------------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| 1 | SSH connection failed with “permission denied (publickey)” | Ensure `authorized_keys` file has `chmod 600` and owned by `root:root`; rebuild container after fix | Wrong file permission after rebuild | SSH / OpenSSH server | Phase 3 – Milestone 1 – Step 2 |
| 2 | “No route to host” when connecting from laptop to firewall container | Recreate Docker network with correct subnet; ensure containers share same bridge | Overlapping/incorrect Docker network subnet | Docker Bridge Networking | Phase 3 – Milestone 1 – Step 3 |
| 3 | `authorized_keys` reverting to directory or empty file | Mount full path to keys explicitly and copy file into container via Dockerfile | Mount misconfiguration during build | Docker volume mounts / Linux filesystem | Phase 3 – Milestone 1 – Step 4 |
| 4 | Ping utility missing in containers | Add `apt install -y iputils-ping` to Dockerfile for all images | Minimal base images omit ping by default | Linux utilities / ICMP | Phase 3 – Milestone 1 – Step 5 |
| 5 | KB logs not updating automatically after core actions | Integrate `log_kb_entry()` into each backend file | Missing logger imports in early code | Python file integration | Phase 4 – Milestone 1 – Step 4 |
| 6 | API not returning data initially | Added proper `jsonify()` responses and default host vars | Missing JSON response structure | Flask REST API | Phase 5 – Milestone 1 – Step 1 |

## 🧩 3. Insights & Learnings

- SSH-key permissions must persist between container rebuilds — automate this step in Dockerfile.  
- Docker network IP range should remain unique per project; document address plan early.  
- Integrating a central logger early simplifies traceability for later GUI analytics.  
- Testing scripts like `test_phase4_integration.py` should be reused for regression testing before each new phase.  
- Flask API serves as a reliable boundary layer; any future GUI simply consumes `/api/*` routes.
