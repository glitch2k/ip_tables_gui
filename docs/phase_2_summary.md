# 🧾 IPTables GUI Project Documentation Stage – Software Status Report

## 🧱 Phase 2: Backend MVP – Core Command Layer

### 🎯 Goal
Develop a local backend engine capable of:
- Managing iptables rules dynamically  
- Persisting configurations to JSON  
- Operating fully inside a Dockerized firewall testbed

---

### 🧩 Milestone 1: Backend File Setup

#### 🧠 Steps
1. Created core backend file: `app/core/iptables_controller.py`
2. Imported key libraries: subprocess, json, Path
3. Defined global configuration path.
4. Added test environment function to verify imports and path resolution.

✅ **Result:**  
Backend file recognized by Python, connected to JSON config path, and test function confirmed working environment.

---

### ⚙️ Milestone 2: Command Execution Engine

#### 🧠 Steps
1. Implemented `run_cmd()` to safely execute system commands and capture errors.
2. Verified command execution using `iptables -L`.
3. Added root permission handling inside container.
4. Tested in `iptables_firewall` container (privileged mode).

✅ **Result:**  
Backend now executes and returns iptables command output successfully.

---

### 🧩 Milestone 3: CRUD Rule Functions

#### 🧠 Steps
1. Added functions: `list_rules()`, `add_rule()`, `delete_rule()`.
2. Verified add/remove functionality inside firewall container.
3. Tested sample ICMP rule lifecycle.

✅ **Result:**  
Dynamic rule manipulation confirmed for `filter`, `nat`, and `mangle` tables.

---

### 💾 Milestone 4: Save & Restore Layer

#### 🧠 Steps
1. Implemented `save_rules_to_json()` and `load_rules_from_json()`.
2. Validated configuration persistence (Add → Save → Flush → Restore → Verify).  
3. Verified correct JSON structure in `/db/config.json`.

✅ **Result:**  
Full firewall state can now be saved, restored, and version-controlled via JSON.

---

### 🧪 Milestone 5: Automated Test Harness

#### 🧠 Steps
1. Created test file: `tests/test_backend.py`
2. Automated workflow: List → Add → Save → Flush → Restore → Verify → Delete.
3. Mounted `/tests` directory to Docker container for live testing.
4. Verified automation inside `iptables_firewall` container.

✅ **Result:**  
All backend functions validated through automated testing.  
No manual interaction required for verification.

## 🧠 Phase 2 Summary

### 📋 Functional Capabilities
| Function | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| `list_rules()` | Lists rules from filter/nat/mangle tables | ✅ |
| `add_rule()` | Adds rules dynamically to chains | ✅ |
| `delete_rule()` | Removes rules from chains | ✅ |
| `save_rules_to_json()` | Saves all tables to JSON | ✅ |
| `load_rules_from_json()` | Restores tables from JSON | ✅ |
| `run_cmd()` | Executes and monitors system commands | ✅ |

---

### 🧰 Environment Setup
| Component | Details |
|------------|----------|
| **Firewall Container** | Ubuntu 22.04, privileged mode |
| **Docker Volumes** | `/app`, `/db`, `/tests` mounted |
| **Config File** | `/db/config.json` acts as source of truth |
| **Automation** | Test harness validates all core functions |

---

### 📊 Overall Phase 2 Status
| Category | Description | Status |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Codebase** | Core backend complete | ✅ |
| **Testing** | Automated test coverage implemented | ✅ |
| **Documentation** | Current stage (in progress) | 🟢 |
| **Stability** | Stable and verified | ✅ |
| **GUI Integration** | Pending next phase | ⏳ |
| **Remote Execution** | Upcoming in Phase 3 | ⏳ |

---

## 🧭 Next Steps – Phase 3: Remote Execution Layer

### 🎯 Goal
Extend backend functionality to **control remote firewalls** via SSH or REST API.

### 🧩 Planned Milestones
| Milestone | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣ | Create `remote_controller.py` to wrap remote command execution |
| 2️⃣ | Add SSH/REST connection management (authentication + session) |
| 3️⃣ | Implement remote version of `run_cmd()` |
| 4️⃣ | Develop `tests/test_remote_backend.py` for remote validation |
| 5️⃣ | Document connection architecture and testing results |

---

✅ **In Summary:**  
Phase 2 has been fully implemented, validated, and documented.  
The backend is now stable, modular, and ready for network-aware expansion in Phase 3.
